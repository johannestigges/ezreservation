# tournament
a small java application to manage a tournament. I use this for a tennis an table tennis double tournament

It has the following features:

- Layout build with javaFX 8.0
- unlimited list of players
- every player can have a handicap (a number that is added to his score)
- write and read tournament data as XML-File
- configure team size (1 = single tournament, 2 = double tournament)
- configure court numbers ( = number of matches per round)
- create unlimited rounds

Have fun!
